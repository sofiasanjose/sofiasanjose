## Sofia Bonoan

3rd year Computer Science & AI student at IE University. Part-time software developer building web apps and automation tools.

I'm working on chatbots with NLP for customer support, a task management app with real-time collaboration, and [Typo](https://github.com/sofiasanjose/typo-blog-app)—a minimalist blogging platform built with Django. Also learning React Native for iOS development and exploring infrastructure with Terraform and Docker.

Combining school with real-world development has taught me more about building software that actually works than any class could.
