3rd year Computer Science & AI student at IE University. I've been obsessed with building software that actually solves problems since I started coding. Right now, I'm working part-time as a software developer while balancing school, which has taught me way more about real-world development than any textbook could.

I'm currently building chatbots with NLP to handle customer support conversations—trying to make them sound less robotic and more helpful. I'm also working on a task management app with real-time collaboration features, because I got frustrated with existing tools not doing what I needed. The project forced me to dive deep into authentication flows, WebSockets for live updates, and how to actually structure a full-stack app that scales.

On the side, I built [Typo](https://github.com/sofiasanjose/typo-blog-app), a minimalist blogging platform for quick notes and everyday writing. It's built with Django and Python, and it's been my playground for learning backend architecture and database design. I'm also exploring React Native to build iOS apps—mobile development is completely different from web, and I'm learning to think about UI/UX in a whole new way.

Lately, I've been getting into infrastructure and DevOps. Playing around with Terraform and Docker to understand how code actually gets deployed and maintained in production. Turns out, writing code is only half the battle—making sure it runs reliably is the other half.
